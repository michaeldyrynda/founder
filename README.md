## Founder base Laravel application

This repo can be used as a base installation for working in your Laravel applications, similar to what you would get with a `laravel new` installation.

It provides some conventions that are used across projects, and adds some external dependencies such as [Honeybadger](https://honeybadger.io) for error tracking.

You can learn more about the code style and application conventions [here](https://style.dyrynda.com.au).
